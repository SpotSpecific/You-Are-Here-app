You Are Here app resources
======================
Â©2012 Spot Specific Ltd.

What is the 'You Are Here' app?
------------
The 'You Are Here' app is a simple demonstration of how to build a geolocating mobile app using the [Spot Specific mobile app authoring system](http://www.spotspecific.com/).

The resources in his repository will allow you to work alongside the accompanying screencast to build up a functioning app which matches the corresponding library app.

Apps built using these resources as a starting point can be output to Android and iOS.

How do I use the code?
------------
The code here is intended to be used along with the corresponding 'Library app', which is available to all Spot Specific customers. This app can be cloned into a user account and used as a starting point for later development.

We've put together [a corresponding screencast](http://www.youtube.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX), which you can follow to find out how to use the code and other resources in this app. We recommend you review this screencast before beginning.

You'll also need a Google Maps API key, available from [Google's developer site](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key). This API key should be entered into the file 'You-Are-Here-Main-Logic.js' inside the Features directory. The API key should be pasted in in place of 'YOURAPIKEY' on line 6 of this file before you upload it to Spot Specific
